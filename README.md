# XProc - A pipelining language - Declarative Amsterdam 2021

[XProc 3.0](https://xproc.org/index.html) is an XML based programming language for complex document processing. Documents flow through pipelines in which steps perform processing like conversion, validation, split, merge, report, etc. Itâ€™s an almost perfect fit for the kind of complex processing necessary in XML document engineering.

[Declarative Amsterdam 2021](https://declarative.amsterdam/) (November 4 and 5, Amsterdam) will kick off with a day of tutorials and workshops. One of these will be an introduction to XProc 3.0.

The [DA-2021-XProc GitHub repository](https://github.com/xatapult/da-2021-xproc) hosts all materials (presentations, exercises, etc.) for this introduction. 

For more information, see the [accompanying GitHub pages site](https://da.xatapult.com/).
