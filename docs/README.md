# XProc - A pipelining language - Declarative Amsterdam 2021

[XProc 3.0](https://xproc.org/index.html) is an XML based programming language for complex document processing. Documents flow through pipelines in which steps perform processing like conversion, validation, split, merge, report, etc. It’s an almost perfect fit for the kind of complex processing necessary in XML document engineering.

[Declarative Amsterdam 2021](https://declarative.amsterdam/) (November 4 and 5, Amsterdam) will kick off with a day of tutorials and workshops. One of these will be an introduction to XProc 3.0.

The [DA-2021-XProc GitHub repository](https://github.com/xatapult/da-2021-xproc) is used to host all materials (presentations, exercises, etc.) for this introduction. It will be filled in the weeks leading up to the conference.

## <a name="tutorial-info"></a>About the tutorial

The XProc 3.0 tutorial will be a mix of theory, demos and practice. If time and technical hurdles allow, attendees can do (simple) exercises to get practice and a feel for the language. The annotated presentation(s) will be available.

### <a name="tutorial-preparations"></a>**IMPORTANT:** Preparations for the tutorial

If you would like to follow along and do some of the exercises yourself during the tutorial, you need a working XProc 3.0 processor present and working:

- Make sure you have a recent version of Java installed and available (I'm not sure which variants/versions are ok. Personally I'm using Amazon Corretto 1.8.0). If you type `java -version` oin the command line something appropriate should happen.
- Download [MorganaXProc-IIIse](https://www.xml-project.com/MorganaXProc-III/) and unzip it somewhere.
- Add the resulting directory on the system's path. If you type `morgana` on the command line there should be some output about its version and a help message about its command line arguments.
- In the tutorial we're not going to use XSLT (so for that you're fine), but doing XSLT in pipelines is very common. However, the distribution of MorganaXProc-IIIse does not include an XSLT processor, you have to add this yourself. The basic information about this is [here](https://www.xml-project.com/files/doc/manual.html#d5e121). For the impatient, here's a quick fix:
  - The `etc/` directory of this [tutorial's GitHub repository](https://github.com/xatapult/da-2021-xproc) contains a Saxon HE 9.9 jar file.
  - Copy this file into Morgana's `MorganaXProc-IIIse_lib/` lib directory.     


## <a name="about"></a>About XProc

### <a name="what-is-xproc"></a>What is XProc?

Let’s try to answer this question with an overview of XProc’s main high-level
characteristics:

- XProc is a programming language, expressed in XML, in which you can write pipelines.
- An XProc pipeline takes data as its input (usually XML) and passes this through specialized steps to produce end results.
- Steps range from simple ones, like reading and writing data, to more complex stuff like splitting/combining/pruning, transformations with XSLT and XQuery, validations against schemas, etc.
- Within a pipeline you can do things like working with variables, branching, looping, catch errors, etc. Everything is based on the data flowing through.
- XProc pipelines are not limited to a linear succession of steps. They can fork and merge.
- XProc allows you to create custom steps by combining other steps. These custom steps can be used just like any other. Custom steps can be collected into libraries.
- XProc aids in the housekeeping surrounding the processing, like inspecting directories, reading documents from zip files, writing things to disk, etc
- There is software that can execute these pipelines, the so-called XProc processors.

Now why and when would this be useful? In the physical world, pipelining and working
in specialized steps is not unusual. Take for instance an oil refinery: it takes crude oil as
its input and, through a series of steps and intermediate products, produces petrol/gasoline,
kerosene, diesel, etc. Just one look shows that refineries take the word “pipeline” very
literal…

A classic from the IT world are of course UNIX pipelines. Some command produces some
output and we do further processing (by, for instance, grep or tail or head) to get the
information needed. The character used for chaining steps, |, is even called the "pipe"
character!

So what are applications of this in the world of information and document processing? One
of the main reasons is that data is often not in the format we need it to be. Some examples:

- We have XML coming from some data source but need HTML for our website.
- Multiple weather stations produce data that needs to be merged into a single consolidating view. From this we produce a map with the information nicely laid out.
- Word processors produce zip files with lots of XML documents inside (most word processors do nowadays). You need the text in some other format so you’ll have to inspect the zip file, combine the XML documents inside and transform the result into what you want.

For straight transformation of XML data there are languages available like XSLT
and XQuery. But more often than not tasks are more complex than can be done in a
single transformation: chaining, splitting an merging comes into play. Surrounding the
transformations you need housekeeping, like where to read from or write to, inspect
directories and zip files and write logs. Also from a software engineering point of view it
is often desirable to work in steps to get more legible and better maintainable code. This is
where XProc comes into play: a single executable language to express this.

### <a name="history"></a>A little history

The previous version of XProc, [XProc 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/), has been around since 2010 but was never really widely used. People found it hard to comprehend, use and overly verbose. Learning materials were hard to find. However, those that climbed the learning curve use it a lot. It’s an extremely useful tool for the complex kind of document processing that happens, for instance, in publishing. 

In 2016 a W3C community group started working on [XProc 3.0](http://spec.xproc.org/master/head/) (a 2.0 proposal with a non-XML syntax never got a lot of support and was therefore abandoned). Main goals were to stay closer to the 1.0 syntax, make the language much more usable, understandable and concise, update the underlying standards (most notably XPath) and allow processing of non-XML documents also.

The [XProc 3.0 specification](https://xproc.org/specifications.html) is in “last call” status and very stable. We’re still working on some last details of some of the steps. There is one working processor ([MorganaXProc-IIIse](https://www.xml-project.com/MorganaXProc-III/)) and one on the way (the 3.0 version of [XML Calabash](https://xmlcalabash.com/)).

We, the people involved in the XProc 3.0 initiative, believe that we’ve turned an old-fashioned, hard to use contraption into an up-to-date and easy to use modern power tool. A tool that can replace many of the incomplete homegrown pipeline implementations that we know are out there.


## <a name="presenter"></a>About the presenter

My name is Erik Siegel. [Xatapult](http://www.xatapult.com) is my (one-man) company, specialized in content engineering and XML processing. Most of my clients are in the publishing industry or involved in standardization.

I come from a technical IT background. Xatapult is deliberately looking for content and XML related projects on all levels: from the strategic use of standards to developing processing applications.

I do not just strive for the best solution from a business and technical perspective, but also for optimal understandability. Therefore, documentation is never an afterthought. I consider my ability to explain and clarify complex technical stuff, both live and in prose, as an important non-technical skill.

In my (recent) past I have given several successful courses on topics such as XML, XSLT and XML Schema, both in-house for clients and for commercial course providers. Most of these courses I developed myself.

In 2014, together with Adam Retter, I wrote 
[a book about eXist-db](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026525.do), an XML database and processing engine. The book was published by O’Reilly and sold world-wide.

In 2016 I became a member of the editing committee for the XProc 3.0 standard. I am the author of the [XProc 3.0 Programmer Reference](https://xmlpress.net/publications/xproc-3-0/), which was published in 2020.

I'm currently working on a book about Schematron, which is expected to be published in the second half of 2022.
